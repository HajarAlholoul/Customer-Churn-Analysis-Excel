# Customer-Churn-Analysis
In this Excel case study, we investigate a dataset froman example telecom company Databel and analyze their churn rates. We will also figure out why customers are churning at the rate they are and how to reduce churn. We will answer these questions by creating calculated columns and fields, building PivotTables, and creating an eye-catching dashboard.
